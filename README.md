# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT 
     job_id,
     job_title ,
     job_location ,
     job_posted_date,
     salary_year_avg,
     company_dim.name AS company_name
     
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id= job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
 LIMIT 100
 ```

 Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range**: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers**: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety**: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
    WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        job_title ,
        salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name AS company_name
        
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id= job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10 )

SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
 ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- **Tableau** is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6. Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT
      skills_dim.skills AS skills,
      COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS demanded_skills

FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim
 ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short= 'Data Analyst' AND
job_work_from_home = true
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demanded_skills DESC
LIMIT 5
```
